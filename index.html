            Projects I've worked on will be here. The projects I have started are mainly in the biotech field.
            Starting in 2025, I will work on building a small AI and an app to track pH and moisture levels in soil
            so that agriculture workers can manage their crops right from their mobile device.

        <p>
            Hi, I'm Sydney! I'm passionate about biotechnology and creative innovation. This portfolio is supposed to be fun and colorful to attract companies like Pinterest, whom I'd like to work for one day. I aim to bridge the gap between science and creativity, finding ways to make biotech accessible and impactful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am new to the tech field, but I have heavy interests to revolutionalize medicine through technology.  I am a senior at Fisk University majoring in Kinesiology and Data Science.  My ultimate career goal is to implement AR into robotic surgery.
